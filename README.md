Bot: [`@doxxbot`](https://warpcast.com/doxxbot)

Anyone can drop a mention to `@doxxbot` in a cast to snoop on a Farcaster user's other social hangouts and top 10 ERC-20 stash, all without leaving Warpcast.

Just for the heck of it, the doxxed user is also notified via a message on [XMTP](https://xmtp.org/) with the replied cast's URL.

_Why?_ It's a seamless way to unmasking identities and spotting potential biases. On the flipside, if you're all about that privacy, the bot's got your back â€“ check how exposed you are and dial it down.
